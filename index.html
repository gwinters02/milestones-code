<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>The ABC</h3>
  <div class="description">In the year 1937, a duo named Dr.John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry designed and built the first ever electronic digital computer.
    Their computer provides a foundation of advances for electronic digital computers. It was designed only to solve systems of linear equations and was a success in 1942. It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations.
    With all this being said, the computer also had its downfalls. For instance, its intermediate storage unit wasn't perfected and the work on the computer was discontinued when John left to work on World War II assignments.
    Even after the computer was discontinued, it helped paved the way for important elements for modern computing which inlcude binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements.

<h4>The 50s</h4>
<h5>The UNIVAC</h5>
<p>In 1951, the universal automatic computer was introduced. It was the first general purpose electronic digital computer desgin for busniess application. The computer was developed by John Eckert and John Mauchly.
Their first UNIVAC was was accepted by the US Census Bureau on March 31th, 1951. Many more were built after that but their 5th machine was used by CBS to predict the results of the 1952 presdential election. The computer was designed
for business use with a fast execution of simple data transport operations, but cusomters from the US Army, Air Force, and Navy were also using the machine for their uses. The UNIVAC was not the lightest piece of machinery. It was said to have used
about 5,000 vacuum tubes while also weighing 8.3 tons but could still perform over 1,900 operations per second.</p>

<h6>FORTRAN</h6>
<p>FORTRAN was the world's first high-level programming language. It was made by a small team at IBM led by John Backus. The earliest verison of FORTRAN was brought into the world at 1957 and used as a programming tool for the IBM
  themselves. Backus's team had implemented the first optimizing compiler, which not only translated FORTRAN programs into the IBM 704's numerical codes, but produced codes which ran very nearly as fast as anything that could be crafted by hand.
Later on in 1958, Backus and his team would release FORTRAN II. This verison provided support for procedural programming by introducing statements to programmers to create subroutines and functions.
Since FORTRAN grew in popularity, many other computer manufacturers tried to implement their own verisons for their own machines and they also added their own customisations which made it impossible to guarantee that a programs
witten for one type of machine would compile and run on a different type.</p>

<div id="title">DEC PDP-1 is Introduced
</div>
<p>The PDP-1 was the first computer in Digital Equipment Corporations's PDP series which was developed in 1959. It's famous
for being the most impotant in the creatoin pf hacker culture at MIT and BBN. The PDP-1 is the orginal hardware for playing
history's first game on the minicomputer.The PDP-1 uses an 18-bit word size and has 4096 words as standard main memory
upgradable to 65,536 words. </p>
