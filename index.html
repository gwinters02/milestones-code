<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<h3>The ABC</h3>
  <div class="description">In the year 1937, a duo named Dr.John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry designed and built the first ever electronic digital computer.
    Their computer provides a foundation of advances for electronic digital computers. It was designed only to solve systems of linear equations and was a success in 1942.
    It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations.John used electricity and electronics as the medium for the computer.
    He used base-two numbers for the computer. John used condensosrs for memory and used a regenerative processto avoid
    lapses that might be cause by leakage of power. The computer also had its downfalls. For instance, its intermediate storage unit wasn't perfected
    and the work on the computer was discontinued when John left to work on World War II assignments.
    Even after the computer was discontinued, it helped paved the way for important elements for modern computing which inlcude binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements.

<h4>The 50s</h4>
<h5>The UNIVAC</h5>
<p>In 1951, the universal automatic computer was introduced. It was the first general purpose electronic digital computer desgin for busniess application. The computer was developed by John Eckert and John Mauchly.
Their first UNIVAC was was accepted by the US Census Bureau on March 31th, 1951. Many more were built after that but their 5th machine was used by CBS to predict the results of the 1952 presdential election. The computer was designed
for business use with a fast execution of simple data transport operations, but cusomters from the US Army, Air Force, and Navy were also using the machine for their uses. The UNIVAC was not the lightest piece of machinery.
It was said to have used about 5,000 vacuum tubes while also weighing 8.3 tons but could still perform over 1,900 operations per second. </p>

<h6>FORTRAN</h6>
<p>FORTRAN was the world's first high-level programming language. It was made by a small team at IBM led by John Backus. The earliest verison of FORTRAN was brought into the world at 1957 and used as a programming tool for the IBM
  themselves. Backus's team had implemented the first optimizing compiler, which not only translated FORTRAN programs into the IBM 704's numerical codes, but produced codes which ran very nearly as fast as anything that could be crafted by hand.
Later on in 1958, Backus and his team would release FORTRAN II. This verison provided support for procedural programming by introducing statements to programmers to create subroutines and functions.
Since FORTRAN grew in popularity, many other computer manufacturers tried to implement their own verisons for their own machines and they also added their own customisations which made it impossible to guarantee that a programs
witten for one type of machine would compile and run on a different type.</p>

<div id="title">DEC PDP-1 is Introduced
</div>
<p>The PDP-1 was the first computer in Digital Equipment Corporations's PDP series which was developed in 1959. It's famous
for being the most impotant in the creation of hacker culture at MIT and BBN. The PDP-1 is the orginal hardware for playing
history's first game on the minicomputer. The PDP-1 uses an 18-bit word size and has 4096 words as standard main memory
upgradable to 65,536 words and uses 2,700 transistors and 3,000 diodes. The computer is made out of DEC 1000-series System Building Blocks,
using micro-alloy and micro-alloy diffused transistors with a rated switching speed of 5 MHz. The PDP-1 weighed around 1,600 pounds. The PDP-1 was designed to operate
with many types of input-output devices with no internal machine changes. The computer is a single address, single instruction,
and stored programs with powerful program features. The computer is fully capable of supporting parallel processing and is unusually versatile.

<div class="web">The World Wide Web
  </div>
<p>The World Wide Web provides users information retrieval service of the Internet. It allows users access
to many documents that are connected to each other by means pf hypertext links. With hypertext, users could selcet a word or phrase from text and thereby access
other documents that contain additional information pertaining to that word/phrase. The web works within the Internet's basic
client-server format. The development of WWW begun in 1989 by Tim Lee and his team. They were able to create a protocol called
HypterText Transfer Protocol which standardized communication between servers and clients. Their web brower that was text-based was made available to the public
in January 1992. The WWW rapidly gained acceptance when the creation of a web browser called Mosaic came into the light.
Mosaic allowed people using the web to use the same sort of 'point and click' graphical manipulations that had been available in personal computers for some years.
By the mid-1990s the World Wide Web had millions of active users.</p>
